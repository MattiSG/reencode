## A simple wrapper for `ffmpeg`

At the time of creation, there were no proper GUIs for H.265 so I ended up using ffmpegâ€™s CLI. While super powerful, it is not the most intuitive. This is just a basic way to store my usual presets with a subset of parameters I tend to adjust.

Evolved from my [DotFiles](https://github.com/MattiSG/DotFiles). Ended up being complex enough to warrant its own small repo.
